This has been on my to-do list for [a long time](/2011/12/09/tumblr-suspended-my-blog.html), so let's get to it!

First, search your favorite search engine for "How to move a blog from Tumblr to GitHub pages". Oh no, the results are unsatisfying!

Next, figure out a way to actually do it.

Finally, write a blog post explaining how you did it, in hopes that it will help someone someday in the future. Is help still a thing? Is information on the internet useful any more? Sadly, these questions are beyond the scope of this article.

### Background

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) runs on a system called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll generates plain HTML files. That means, if you make a blog in Jekyll, you can deploy it to GitHub Pages or any other web host that is capable of serving plain HTML files. Lots of people like GitHub Pages because it is easy and free, but you can also deploy your Jekyll blog, for example, to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). This makes Jekyll a great choice if you would like the flexibility to easily move your blog somewhere else in the future.

### Running the import tool

Jekyll actually has a built-in [Tumblr import tool](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/tumblr/). It's not perfect, but it will get you most of the way there. (Also, Jekyll has import tools for [lots of other blog systems](https://import.jekyllrb.com) too!)

Start by making a new Jekyll blog (if you haven't already):

```
bundle init
bundle add jekyll jekyll-import
bundle exec jekyll new
```

Then run the import tool:

```
bundle exec jekyll-import tumblr --url 'https://your-blog-url.example' --format md --grab_images true --rewrite_urls true
```

**Important caveat:** As of writing, the `--rewrite_urls` option is currently broken in Ruby 3.0 or later. If the import fails, you can try running it without that option:

```
bundle exec jekyll-import tumblr --url 'https://your-blog-url.example' --format md --grab_images true
```

What does that option do for you? Well, I'm not entirely sure, because I wasn't able to find any documentation! But, as far as I can tell, most of what it does is to create redirects that map from the Tumblr-style URLs to the new Jekyll URLs. It also seems to rewrite the URLs in links within the post text, but not always (see additional info about that below).

So if you were previously hosting your Tumblr blog on your own domain name, and you want to reuse the same domain name for your Jekyll or GitHub Pages blog, this is a very good option to have. If you're changing to a new domain name, it probably doesn't matter, and you can skip it.

If you need `--rewrite_urls` and it's not working, see the next section for a workaround.

After you've run the importer, if it finished successfully, take a look at your generated blog using the built-in web server:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Point your web browser to `http://localhost:4000` to see what it looks like.

Clean up anything that doesn't look right (there are some more tips below), then deploy when you're ready.

### Deploying

If you're using GitHub Pages:

1. Push to a public repo
2. Go to the repo Settings and look for "Pages".
3. I suggest using "Source: Deploy from a branch" because it's much simpler. Choose "GitHub Actions" if you feel your life is not already complicated enough.
4. Choose which branch to deploy from (usually `main`)
5. Set up your custom domain, if desired
6. Give it a few minutes to generate, then it should be live!

After you have set this up the first time, in the future, you'll only need to do a `git push`, and your changes will be generated and published automatically (after a brief delay).

If you want to deploy to a static page web host or web server, like Amazon S3:

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll build`
2. Upload the contents of `_build` to your web host
3. In the case of S3, make sure to change the access permissions on your bucket to make it suitable for web hosting (world readable, etc.). This is a bit outside the scope of this article, as S3 administration can require some learning. Good luck!

### Running a local version of the import tool

So you've decided you need `--rewrite_urls` but it's not working. Or maybe some other part of it isn't working, and you want to try to fix it yourself.

This happened to me, and I was able to debug the import tool and get it working. [My fixes are in this pull request](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/pull/548), which as of writing, hasn't been merged yet. (I'll try to come back and update this post if or when it gets merged.)

1. Clone the [jekyll-import](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import) Git repo and checkout the desired branch. If you are trying to get my fix, it's [here](https://github.com/dmdeller/jekyll-import/tree/fix-tumblr-import).
2. Optionally make any changes to the code.
3. `bundle install`
4. Run `./exe/jekyll-import` with the same flags as in the original how to steps above.
5. Manually copy these folders into your blog source repo: `_posts` (where the new Jekyll posts are), `post` (redirect files that map the old Tumblr URLs to the new ones), `tumblr_files` (images and other media)

At this point, you should hopefully have a successfully imported Tumblr blog, including URL redirects.

### Things you may still need to clean up

* You may want to search your existing posts for specific strings in order to find what needs fixing. You can use the classic Unix tool `grep` for this, but I've found a much better alternative in [ack](https://beyondgrep.com). Mac users can install this with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

* If you have blog posts that link to your other blog posts, the importer rewrites most of these links, but it tends to miss some of them. `ack https://your-blog-url.example/post` to find these. Unfortunately, you'll probably need to fix these by hand.

* The importer may occasionally continue to reference some images, or other media files, at their original Tumblr URLs. `ack media.tumblr.com` to find these. You'll want to manually download each one and then correct the URL on each post.

* Any footnotes in your original posts may be somewhat broken; they still render correctly, but the links to jump back and forth between footnote and text don't seem to work any more. I haven't found a fix for this yet, other than manually redoing them all.

* HTML tags for tables (and maybe other things) end up getting escaped, and probably need to be fixed by hand.

### Don't forget to write some stuff!

Blogging is cool.

What's a good topic? When I can't think of anything to write, I like to write about how I solved some sort of technical issue I was having recently. Sometimes, maybe this helps someone! It's hard to tell if search engines still work these days - so I don't know if anyone will be able to find the information - but we can hope.
