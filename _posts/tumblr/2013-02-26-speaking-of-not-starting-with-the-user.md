[Speaking of (not) starting with the user...](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/the-folly-of-david-cage-its-not-technology-that-keeps-games-from-becoming-e)  

In [related topics](/2013/02/26/app-net-continues-in-the-same-direction-backwards.html), it occurred to me that Sony has had a similar problem for seemingly forever. They brag about megaflops or whatever, and expect someone else to do all the work. What exactly is supposed to get me excited about playing PS4? Will it have Mario Kart? How about Final Fantasy? Oh, really–_when?_

But this is such an old trope in video games, that there’s even a pithy trusim for it: _It’s the software, stupid._

The ‘software’ in this expression is not meant to be the sort that runs on a headless Linux server somewhere, dumping logs into a text-based console; instead, it refers to the kind of software that people _actually use_.
