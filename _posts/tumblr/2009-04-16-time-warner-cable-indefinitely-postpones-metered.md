[Time Warner Cable indefinitely postpones metered billing](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/04/theyre-gone-after-outcry-time-warner-uncaps-the-tubes.ars)  

I bet it was Frontier (local DSL provider) preparing an [ad campaign targetting this issue](http://stopthecap.com/2009/04/16/frontier-officially-abandons-usage-caps-but-thats-old-news-to-stop-the-cap-readers/) that pushed them over the edge.

But they’ll bring it back eventually. Count on it. Even Frontier still has [their own 5 GB limit](http://www.frontier.com/policies/residential_aup/) on the books, even if it’s not currently being enforced.
