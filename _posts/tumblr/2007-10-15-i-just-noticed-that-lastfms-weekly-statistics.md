I just noticed that Last.fm’s weekly statistics show the entirety of Radiohead’s new 10-track album, [In Rainbows](http://www.inrainbows.com), occupying the top 10 tracks across their entire userbase. Not only that, but the tracks appear in the list in the exact same order as on the album (i.e., track 1 has most listeners, track 2 slightly less, etc.) Based on the number of unique listeners (top figures), and assuming anyone who reached the 10th track listened to each other track at least once at some point, we can conclude that 83.5% of Last.fm users who gave the album a try ended up listening to it all the way through at least once.

You can see it [here](http://www.last.fm/music/+charts/?charttype=weekly&subtype=track&range=1191758400-1192363200). (Edit: occurred to me Last.fm might also have some commentary. And so [they do](http://blog.last.fm/2007/10/15/spot-the-difference).)
