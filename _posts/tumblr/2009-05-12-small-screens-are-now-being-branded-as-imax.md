[Small screens are now being branded as 'IMAX'](http://azizisbored.tumblr.com/post/106587114/reblog-the-fuck-out-of-this-warning-amc-theaters-are?dsq=9260263)  

(Warning: language in above link.) Always seemed a bit pricey to me anyway, but maybe it’s one of those things you have to see to understand. Now I’m even less likely to try it.

What’s next - branding random things ‘HD’ because most people [can’t tell the difference](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/blu-ray-do-consumers-care/) anyway? Oh wait, that’s [already](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_Radio) [happening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_Photo).
