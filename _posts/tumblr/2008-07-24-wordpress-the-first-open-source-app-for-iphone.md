[WordPress: the first open-source app for iPhone, in violation of the NDA?](http://iphone.wordpress.org/)  

This is interesting, because [most everyone reasonably believed](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/23/2222204&from=rss) that the [Non-Disclosure Agreement](http://fuckingnda.com/) you have to sign in order to get [the SDK](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/) prohibits you from releasing any source code.

While some, like Gruber, have decided to be a [jackass](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/07/24/wordpress-iphone) about it (yeah, I went there), most of us are left wondering if the WordPress team [misinterpreted the NDA](http://twitter.com/chockenberry/statuses/867307327) or just decided to [flip Apple the bird](http://twitter.com/atomicbird/statuses/867398198).
