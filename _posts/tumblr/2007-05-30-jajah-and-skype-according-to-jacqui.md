[Jajah and Skype, according to Jacqui](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070529-trouble-for-skype-on-line-1-intel-deutsche-telekom-invest-in-jajah.html)  

Obviously Jajah is going to annihilate Skype, because the one with the most investor capital always wins, and whoâ€™s ever heard of this eBay thing anyway. Also, VoIP is much more convenient when it requires a physical phone line subscription in addition to internet access (Jajah), as opposed to only requiring internet access (Skype)! After all, the entire point of VoIP is to keep you tied to the traditional analog telephone system.
