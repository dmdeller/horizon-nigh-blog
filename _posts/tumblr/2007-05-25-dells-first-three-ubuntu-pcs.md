[Dell's first three Ubuntu PCs](http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x)  

Here they are. [Slightly cheaper](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~ntuck/dellbuntu/) than Windows equivalents, but that’s not really the reason for getting one, is it?

Glaring error in their copy:

> Ubuntu is a community developed, Linux-based operating system. It’s also one of the most popular open source operating system _(sic)_ on the planet.

I’m sure if they had put some effort into that, they could have made it sound more appealing, and, er… grammatical.

**Update:** here’s something I didn’t notice at first:

> Dell provides hardware support only. Software support is available through Canonical and Linux Community.

Dell helpfully offers to add software support to your shopping cart: $65 for 30 days, $125 for 1 year ‘Basic’, $275 for 1 year 'Standard’. All three will presumably get you a direct line to Canonical, the company that created Ubuntu. Expensive.
