[Marco Arment: How to bring good design to a platform](http://www.marco.org/2011/10/20/how-to-bring-good-design-to-a-platform)  

I would generalise the headline Marco gave to this post like so:

_How to bring good design to a product_

‘Product’ means anything that a company produces and people want to buy. A 'platform’ means something more specific, but I think Marco’s list applies to any kind of product.

If I can extend my [tortured grocery store analogy](http://blog.horizon-nigh.org/post/11499512502) just a little bit more: looking at his list, you could apply the same to Wegmans (as he implicitly applies it to Apple).

This led me to realise something else: people don’t go to Wegmans to buy food. You can buy food anywhere. They go to Wegmans to buy _the experience of going to Wegmans_. Wegmans _is_ the product.

It actually validates the case for selling a product that is 'merely’ a platform for selling other products, in an industry where you might not have expected to see it.
