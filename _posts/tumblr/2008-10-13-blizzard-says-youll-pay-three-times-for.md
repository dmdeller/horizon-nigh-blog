[Blizzard says: You'll pay three times for StarCraft II, and you'll like it](http://www.edge-online.com/features/blizzard-were-not-milking-starcraft)  

> In StarCraft II, we’re going to have a campaign that focuses strictly on the Terran. It’ll be 26-30 missions long, and you’ll play as Jim Rainer. When we release first expansion set, that’s going to focus on Zerg. So that’s going to be another 26-30 missions strictly focusing on Zerg. When we go to the final expansion pack, it will be the Protoss experience, probably another 26-30 missions.

That’s nice, but the main point of single-player mode in a real-time strategy game is to learn how to play each race, offline, before you compete with other people. The story, although important, has to be secondary to that.

This is a company that has done literally everything right–not just right, but outstandingly above and beyond the competition–for as long as I can remember. Now, look how far they have fallen in their greed.

This is not a hard problem to solve: you put a _short_ campaign for each race in the first box. Then you can expand upon them later in–wait for it–the _expansions._ That’s what ‘expansion’ means. It doesn’t mean 'the rest of the game you should have got in the first place’.

> I think the readers aren’t understanding that there’s a full, gi-normous single-player campaign experience in each of these three products.

Yes, that’s it. It couldn’t be that we hate what you’re doing, it must be that we don’t _understand._ Go ahead, insult the intelligence of your customers. Great _strategy._
