[Safari 3 Public Beta - Mac and WINDOWS](http://www.apple.com/safari/)  

Opera has the worst HTML performance? I donâ€™t believe that.

Interesting how the Windows screen shots show Windows XP instead of Vista (it works on both). Perhaps as a subtle jab at Microsoft, perhaps a reflection that most people still use (and therefore recognise) XP.&nbsp;
