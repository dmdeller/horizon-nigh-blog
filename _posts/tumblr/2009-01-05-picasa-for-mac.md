[Picasa for Mac](http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2009/01/picasas-macworld-debut.html)  

Beta, naturally.

Now I see what I’ve been missing from iPhoto all these years: ‘teh snappy’.

I think I still prefer the feel of iPhoto, though. Like most Google things, it feels somehow messier.

But, my oh my, is it ever snappy. Hopefully this will light a fire under Apple.

For a limited time only (I’m guessing), the download apparently doesn’t come with a forced install of Google’s fascist software updater. ( **Edit** : [this is incorrect](http://linklog.horizon-nigh.org/2009/01/30/google-software-update-is-basically-malware.html).)
