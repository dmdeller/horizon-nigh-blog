[Coda 2 + Diet Coda](http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/05/announcing-coda-2-and-introducing-diet-coda/)  

I don’t link to stuff much any more unless I have something in particular to say about it–and I’m much better at critiquing than complimenting–but it didn’t seem right to break from tradition: [previously](/2007/04/23/panic-coda-one-window-web-development-for-mac.html-os-x), [previously](/2008/08/30/coda-15.html).

Diet Coda is fun, even if I don’t currently have a practical use for it. But then, I said the same thing at first about the iPad itself, and now it’s hard to imagine not having it.

Although, after all these years, I still don’t know why the icon is a leaf.

1. Other tools I use on a daily basis, like Xcode and GitHub for Mac, I have more of a love/hate relationship with, where I admire their design but am continually frustrated with bugs and shortcomings. And then there are the apps that are just broken: Finder, iTunes, Skype, …&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
