[David Pogue on the Canon S95](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/a-love-letter-to-a-camera/)  

> I love the wink-driven self-timer. Yes, I set up the camera, walk into the scene, and then wink—the picture is taken two seconds later. Beats hunting around for a remote control. (Or I can ask you to wait two seconds after a new person—that would be me, joining the group—enters the frame.)

Ingenious.
