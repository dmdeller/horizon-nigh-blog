[New Smashing Pumpkins album to come in multiple versions; no 'complete' version](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43795-smashing-pumpkins-to-fans-indie-stores-fuck-you)  

(Warning: NSFW language.) Only one of the four versions has the albumâ€™s title track. There is no single version that has all of the songs. What the hell? Guys, this is not encouraging your fans to support you financially, if you know what I mean.
