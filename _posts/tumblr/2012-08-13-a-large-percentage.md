['A large percentage'](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/the-power-of-toys-par-plays-with-the-3ds-xl)  

Ben Kuchera on the Nintendo 3DS XL:

> Nintendo can count on a large percentage of customers upgrading their existing 3DS hardware to the XL, which means moving your content is an important feature.

This quote perfectly illustrates the insular nature of the tech and gaming press. Kuchera’s friends and associates–the people he talks to regularly–probably upgrade to every minor hardware revision of every major console; if it doesn’t seem worthwhile, they might grumble a little, but they’ll still buy it anyway.

Most people do not do this.

Right now, Nintendo’s biggest hurdle is still in informing their customers that the 3DS even exists; ‘a large percentage’<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of DS owners, even if they’ve heard of it, do not even understand that the 3DS is a separate and incompatible console from the one they already own. (The Wii U will have this problem as well, which is not helped by Nintendo’s baffling naming choices.)
