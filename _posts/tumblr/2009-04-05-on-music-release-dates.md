Here’s a thought: why not just release the album when it’s done? Wouldn’t promotion work even better that way? ‘Try to remember to check it out on this random date! Since you don’t have enough appointments in your life already!’ vs. 'Available now–surprise! Go buy it!’

But no, they finish it and then shelve it for two or three months. Then they act all surprised and hurt when it leaks on the internet. Duh!

And don’t give me any crap about distribution channels taking time to produce pieces of plastic and cardboard and move them around. This is 2009: we have the _internet_. If your old distribution channels are slowing you down, don’t wait for them. They can release when they’re ready. If they raise too much of a fuss about competitive disadvantages due to non-simultaneous release, just&nbsp;_dump them_ already. They’re dinosaurs, they’ll be extinct soon anyway, and their desperate attempts at self-preservation are only hurting you. Trust me, your target audience knows how to use the freaking internet.

Yes, it’s a risk. But an even bigger risk would be to ignore obvious trends. Sometimes the market presents you with uncomfortable choices. You deal with it or you get trampled.

But of course, this is the music industry we’re talking about. They would never try to just bury their heads in the sand. Right.
