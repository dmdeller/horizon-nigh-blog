[Upcoming fourth season of Battlestar Galactica to be the last](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/11/158218&from=rss)  

Vastly preferable to either (a) being cancelled after a cliffhanger or (b) running for long after the writers have totally run out of ideas. Ideally, I would have liked to see maybe one more season after this, but oh well.

I was about to say we still have [Caprica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprica_(TV_series)), but it looks like thatâ€™s fizzling out.
