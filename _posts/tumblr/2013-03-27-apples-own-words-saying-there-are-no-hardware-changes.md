[Apple's own words saying there are no hardware changes in the T-Mobile iPhone 5](https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=593719&fcc_id=BCG-E2599A)  

> This is to request a Class II Permissive Change for FCC ID: BCG-E2599A originally granted on 09/12/2012.
> 
> The change filed under this application is:
> 
> Change #1 – Adding UMTS Band IV (1700 MHz)
> 
> The addition of this UMTS band does not require any hardware changes to the approved device. There is no increase in the output power rating on this additional UMTS band and the Equipment Class remains the same. There are no other changes to the device.

Thanks to [this poster](http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1794330-Iphone-5-with-tmobile?p=15093435#post15093435) on HowardForums.

[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/iphone-5-att-aws-unlocked-plans-t-mobile/), yesterday:

> Apple affirmed to us that it’s not something that can be enabled via a simple software update for A1428 iPhone units already in circulation.

That’s not a direct quote from Apple, so it’s possible that Engadget misunderstood. However, assuming they didn’t: I wish PR people would learn the difference between ‘can’t’ and 'won’t’.
