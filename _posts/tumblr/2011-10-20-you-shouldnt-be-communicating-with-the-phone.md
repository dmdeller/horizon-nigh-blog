[You shouldn't be communicating with the phone](http://allthingsd.com/20111019/android-chief-says-your-phone-should-not-be-your-assistant/)  

Andy Rubin, head of Android at Google, talking about [Siri](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html):

> Your phone is a tool for communicating. You shouldn’t be communicating with the phone; you should be communicating with somebody on the other side of the phone.

I like this quote a lot because it has an additional layer of meaning beyond what’s obvious. To Google, the phone (or any device) is just a vessel for using Google services. Google doesn’t want you to use your phone; they want you to use Google through your phone.
