[Differences between UK and US editions of Harry Potter books](http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/potter.html)  

I had thought about getting the UK version of _Deathly Hallows_, but I didn’t: there was the additional expense, the additional wait, and (silliest reason of all) the US edition covers by Mary GrandPré are much prettier.
