[Die, contracts! Prepaid mobile phone use surges](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/prepaid-mobile-phone-users-in-america-hit-record-high/)  

I hope this becomes a trend.

With such low-cost prepaid service available, what possible reason is there to sign a contract? Not being able to get the phone you want might be one, but that is seemingly becoming less of an issue.

Good riddance.
