[iTunes Plus (256kbps, no DRM) now available](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/may#wed-30-itunes_plus)  

I still think the bitrate upgrade is stupid. [No-one can tell the difference](http://duxlist.com:81/) between 128kbps AAC and the original CD. Itâ€™s a waste of bandwidth and disk space.

Update: iTunes 7.2 has much faster scroll speed when showing cover art for me (Mac/Intel).
