[PSP2 still coming?](http://www.psp-vault.com/News-article-sid-958.psp)  

I wouldn’t link to this if it were any site other than PSP-Vault, which I hold in great esteem, although the site’s owner (zmcnulty) doesn’t seem too happy about the article.

I finally made the jump to a ‘homebrew’ firmware for my PSP, and it’s had the effect of transforming the machine from a bookend into something I actually like almost as much as my DS again. The other nice effect of it is, since any hardware revision will almost certainly make homebrew much harder, I won’t feel gypped for owing the original hardware.
