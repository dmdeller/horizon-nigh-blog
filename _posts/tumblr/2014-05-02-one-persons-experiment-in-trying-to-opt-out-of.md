[One person's experiment in trying to opt out of Big Data](http://time.com/83200/privacy-internet-big-data-opt-out/)  

The author was trying to prevent any company from knowing about her pregnancy:

> For example, seven months in, my uncle sent me a Facebook message, congratulating me on my pregnancy. My response was downright rude: I deleted the thread and unfriended him immediately. When I emailed to ask why he did it, he explained, ‘I didn’t put it on your wall.’ Another family member who reached out on Facebook chat a few weeks later exclaimed, ‘I didn’t know that a private message wasn’t private!’

Speaking of user education problems. People have no idea how their data is being used.

Even that doesn’t quite encompass the scope of the problem: it doesn’t even occur to people that their everyday activities as they go about their lives _are_ data. 20 years ago, if you wrote a letter to someone, or called them on the phone, that wasn’t ‘data’. Now it is.
