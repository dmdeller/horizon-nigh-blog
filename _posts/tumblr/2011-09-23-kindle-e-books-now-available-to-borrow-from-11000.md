Fascinating. It appears that each library only has a limited number of ‘copies’ that they can lend at a time. It seems that demand may currently be higher than they had anticipated.

Here’s [the Boston Public Library’s collection](http://overdrive.bpl.org/45F283D0-663D-4AD1-86B1-41EAA5F4B6C8/10/380/en/SearchResults.htm?SearchID=664365s) (library card required) and [Amazon’s FAQ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200747550).
