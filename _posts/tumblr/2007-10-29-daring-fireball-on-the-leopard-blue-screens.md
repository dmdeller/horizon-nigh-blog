[Daring Fireball on the Leopard 'blue screens'](http://daringfireball.net/2007/10/blue_in_the_face)  

Sometimes Apple deserve the bad press they get. This is not one of those times.

cf. [Logitech Mac drivers](/2007/06/28/all-logitech-mac-drivers-silently-install-unsanity.html). Incidentally, with Leopard, the multimedia buttons on my Logitech keyboard, and the horizontal scrolling on my Logitech mouse, all work with nothing extra (read: nothing from Logitech) installed.
