[Starcraft updated to no longer require the CD to play](http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=21150&rhtml=true)  

Convenient. It’s neat that after 10 years, Blizzard is still making sure that this game runs well.

Also, did you know that it’s available as a [download](http://www.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=110000124) now?

**Edit:** turns out the same is true for WarCraft III, now; no extra file copying is necessary.

**Edit 2:** you can now [register](https://www.blizzard.com/account/management/games.xml) said games with Blizzard, and then download them again anytime, anywhere, just like Steam.
