[Google 'Personalized Search' is now on by default for everyone, even if they're not signed in](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/personalized-search-for-everyone.html)  

The problem with this is that most people will not have any idea it is happening, let alone how to turn it off. I donâ€™t think Google cares; they only care what will get more clicks.
