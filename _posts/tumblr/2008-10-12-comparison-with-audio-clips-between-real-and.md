[Comparison (with audio clips) between real and fake-leaked versions of Ben Folds's 'Way To Normal'](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/22595157/why_i_leaked_it_ben_folds_comes_clean_about_his_fake_and_real_new_album_way_to_normal)  

What’s sad is that, if you don’t read the text, it’s sometimes difficult to tell which is supposed to be the ‘good’ and which is supposed to be the 'bad’ version. And I say this as a long time Ben Folds/BF5 fan.
