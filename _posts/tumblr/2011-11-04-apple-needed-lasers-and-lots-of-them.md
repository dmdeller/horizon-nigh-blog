[Apple needed lasers, and lots of them](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/apples-supplychain-secret-hoard-lasers-11032011.html)  

> About five years ago, Apple design guru Jony Ive decided he wanted a new feature for the next MacBook: a small dot of green light above the screen, shining through the computer’s aluminum casing to indicate when its camera was on. The problem? It’s physically impossible to shine light through metal.

But they found a way. I noticed this when I first got one of the wireless aluminium keyboards. Very cool.
