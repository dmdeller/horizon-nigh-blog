[Virgin Mobile's $40 unlimited MiFi - David Pogue](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/technology/personaltech/02pogue.html?_r=1&ref=technology)  

Been using this for a few months now, and love it. This + iPod Touch + cheap prepaid phone = no need for AT&T ever.

Also: Internet radio in the car. Awesome. (I recommend [TuneIn Radio](http://www.tunein-radio.com/). Go to settings, set buffering to 30 seconds - with this I can listen to 128kbps streams with hardly any drop-outs.)

Pogue also has a [follow-up](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/more-on-the-virgin-mifi/).
