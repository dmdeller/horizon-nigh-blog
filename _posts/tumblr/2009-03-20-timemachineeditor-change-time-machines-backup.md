[TimeMachineEditor: Change Time Machine's backup schedule](http://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/)  

Awesome. Unlike some of the rather sketchy-looking&nbsp;utilities&nbsp;I’ve seen, this doesn’t mess with the backup daemon - it just edits a [configuration file](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/03/set-your-own-backup-schedule-with-timemachineeditor.ars) (which I had previously been editing by hand).

Since Time Machine already supports these options, they really should be present in System Preferences, even if hidden under an ‘Advanced…’ section or something. I get that Apple was trying to make the concept of backups drop-dead simple in order to appeal to the masses, but making these options inaccessible was taking it a bit too far.
