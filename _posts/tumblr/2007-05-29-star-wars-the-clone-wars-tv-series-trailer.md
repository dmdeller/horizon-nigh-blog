[Star Wars: 'The Clone Wars' TV series trailer](http://starwars.com/video/view/000478.html)  

Takes place in between Episodes II and III, and after the confusingly-similarly-named cartoon miniseries. Note that this is only one of the two TV series that were announced [a while ago](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/04/27).

I dunno… even as someone who actually liked the prequels (yes, even Episode I, though not as much) this seems a bit like overkill. They even had the gall to reuse the music from Episode III’s climax, which this certainly does not match. (via Slashdot, et al.)
