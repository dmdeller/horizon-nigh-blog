[More details about the T-Mobile iPhone 5 model](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6860/apple-to-ship-updated-a1428-iphone-5-with-aws-wcdma-enabled-for-tmobile-usa)  

Exact same hardware, just newer firmware. Even the same FCC ID, which I understand to mean that the FCC approval for the new bands retroactively applies to the original A1428 model. So why canâ€™t I have this new firmware?
