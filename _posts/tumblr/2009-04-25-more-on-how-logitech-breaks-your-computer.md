Continued from our earlier discussion ([part 1](http://linklog.horizon-nigh.org/2007/06/28/all-logitech-mac-drivers-silently-install-unsanity.html), [part 2](http://linklog.horizon-nigh.org/2007/10/29/daring-fireball-on-the-leopard-blue-screens.html)).

Read this series of Twitter posts from Wil Shipley if youâ€™re still not convinced that you should never, ever use Logitech products (or at least, their software) with a Mac. [[1]](http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/1617759907) [[2]](http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/1617764796) [[3]](http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/1617765573) [[4]](http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/1617789347) [[5]](http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/1617832987) [[6]](http://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/1617836772)&nbsp;(Warning: language)

According to [this](http://twitter.com/bbum/status/1617806493), Logitech are no longer using Unsanity components; instead, they are using [InputManagers](http://www.macjournals.com/news/inputmanagerhacks.html) to similar effect.

Whether or not InputManagers should be used, generally speaking, is an argument for the ages. That is not the issue here. The issue here is that everyone needs to understand and carefully consider the risks involved before making their choice; Logitech is making that choice for you, without telling you about it. That is not okay.
