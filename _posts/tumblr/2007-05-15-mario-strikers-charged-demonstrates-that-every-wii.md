[Mario Strikers Charged demonstrates that every Wii game will have its own set of friend codes](http://www.evilavatar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=29959&)  

All I want is a statement–an explanation–from Nintendo as to _why_ they are doing this.

I can deal with one friend code per console - it’s like an ICQ number, or a phone number, sure. I get the privacy argument. But per game? I just don’t see the benefit of taking it that far, and I do see the additional annoyance.
