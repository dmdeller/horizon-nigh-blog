[Coda 1.5](http://stevenf.com/archive/coda-1.5.php)  

Awesome. At work, this free update has removed _two_ external programs from my workflow - my Subversion client, and [ack](http://petdance.com/ack/). Less context switching, not to mention the fact that every inch of Coda is designed so well.

Truly, they live up to the tagline ‘shockingly good Mac software’.
