This is the dialog you get when you don’t have Flash installed on Mac OS X, and you click<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the ‘Missing Plug-In’ text on a page that has a Flash applet.

I assumed it would link you to the page where you can download Flash, but no. Just in case it wasn’t perfectly clear, Apple _really_ doesn’t like Flash and isn’t going to help you install it.
