[Why Are T1 Lines Still Expensive?](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/25/207216&from=rss)  

My freshman year roommate told me he had a T1 line going into his home. I asked why he would want that if he could have faster and cheaper cable modem. He insisted that T1 was much faster, despite my attempts to explain things like Mbps to him. (I realise there’s an argument to be made for guaranteed reliability vs. best-effort. It doesn’t apply to someone like him.)

I later found out he just made up the whole thing, like he made up a lot of the things he said. I still don’t understand why.
