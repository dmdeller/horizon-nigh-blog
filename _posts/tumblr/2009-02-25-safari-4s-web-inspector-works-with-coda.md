[Safari 4's web inspector works with Coda](http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/81476844/if-you-have-the-safari-4-beta-installed-you)  

With no change to Coda, in fact. This is what software developers mean when they talk about getting something ‘for free’.

(This is the kind of free that doesn’t refer to cost, or even open-source-style freedom; free as in, I didn’t have to do any work, so now I’m freeeee!)
