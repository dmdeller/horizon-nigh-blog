<dd>wtf nintendo</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>3ds peripheral adds a second analog stick</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>if they wanted that, it should have been built-in since the beginning</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>it looks horrible and is powered separately</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>what were they thinking?!</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>now i feel like i have to wait in case they come out with a 3ds with a built-in second stick</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>yeah.</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>it's ridiiculous</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>with three i's!</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>exactly</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>that's how ridiculous it is</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>3Is</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>Nintendo 3IS: now with even more ridiiculous, and if you didn't think it was possible, an even worse name</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>yes</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>what do you call a pig with three eyes?</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>piiig</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>heh</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>well, this makes my decision easier, i guess</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>i have too many games this fall/winter anyway, so i just won't get mario kart 3ds and super mario 3ds right away</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>yeah</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>i'll wait till the inevitable 3DS redesign</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>was me plan from the start</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>really, 5 hours with everything set to minimum and no 3d?</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>maybe it will have the second stick, maybe it won't, but there will be a redesign before too long for sure</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>and if the redesign doesn't have a second stick, then i'll be reasonably reassured that it won't be a built-in feature</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>yup</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>since it seems most probable that if they're ever going to do it, they'd do it sooner rather than later</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>i just can't believe... a separate battery</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>for a STICK</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>because the battery is so bad to begin with</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>although</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>now you have *two* batteries to keep track of, and either one of them dying will result in you not being able to play your game (at least, not the way you want to)</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>yup</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>i don't know what happened to nintendo</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>they rushed the 3DS out</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>it really wasn't ready</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>and no games for it</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>"must be out before new psp! and we has 3Dness! WE WILL PRINT MONEY AGAIN"</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>maybe they're desperate, but that still doesn't explain the stick thing</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>rumor has it they were considering having a second analog stick intiially, but it wasn't ready yet</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>at the very least, if they absolutely must have a second stick for some reason, save it until the redesign, so they're not making people like me nervous</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>people would be pissed off if they bought the first 3ds, but it still seems less bad</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>thumbstylus</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>it's $20, they can't be making much of a profit on that SKU</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>and how was the second stick not ready initially</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>were they not able to get this futuristic SECOND STICK TECHNOLOGY working properly in time?!</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>in the future, perhaps all games will have a SECOND STICK!</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>heh</dd>
<dt>David:</dt>
<dd>maybe they can even come out with an addon for the wii! it would come with a coupon for a discount on a third arm so you can hold the wiimote and two nunchucks</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>yes</dd>
<dt>Patrick:</dt>
<dd>and a cup holder</dd></dialog></section>
