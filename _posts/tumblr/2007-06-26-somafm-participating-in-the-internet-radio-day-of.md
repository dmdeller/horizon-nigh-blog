[SomaFM participating in the Internet Radio Day of Silence](http://somafm.com/crb/)  

I just tuned into Groove Salad to find that there were significantly fewer beats and textures than usual, heh.

SomaFM and others are broadcasting silence, static or ambient noise all day long in protest of new royalty fees that would effectively kill most internet radio stations.
