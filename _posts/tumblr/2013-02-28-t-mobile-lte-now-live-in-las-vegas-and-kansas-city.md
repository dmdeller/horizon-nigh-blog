[T-Mobile LTE now live in Las Vegas and Kansas City](http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/articles/t-mobile-2012-fourth-quarter-operating-results)  

> LTE networks have been completed in Las Vegas, NV and Kansas City, MO and are ready for customers as LTE devices launch in 2013.

Also, looks like Boston is finally getting filled out a bit in [this unofficial map of iPhone-compatible 3G areas](http://airportal.de). It’s been mostly stagnant since last year, but more data points have appeared in the past month or so.

I’m still waiting for the network to look good enough to bring over my unlocked iPhone. I have no contract, so I could do so any time, but it’s just not worth degrading my already-mediocre AT&T 3G service. I had hoped T-Mobile would be in better shape by now, but progress has been slow.
