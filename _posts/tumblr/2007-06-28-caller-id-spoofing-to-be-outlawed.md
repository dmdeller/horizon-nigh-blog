[Caller ID spoofing to be outlawed](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070627-caller-id-spoofing-about-to-be-outlawed.html)  

Particularly interesting to me, since I subscribe to [SkypeOut](http://skype.com/products/skypeout/) - all of my calls from the service appear to be from the number ‘0000123456’. This is annoying because I also subscribe to [SkypeIn](http://skype.com/products/skypein/), meaning I actually do have a dialable local phone number associated with my account - why can’t Skype send that as my caller ID? I’m told that this is precisely what competitor [Yahoo Voice](http://voice.yahoo.com/) does.

**Update** : apparently Skype now offers sending correct Caller ID information as an option for many countries… but not the [United States](http://support.skype.com/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&_j=questiondetails&_i=1269). They say they’re working on it.
