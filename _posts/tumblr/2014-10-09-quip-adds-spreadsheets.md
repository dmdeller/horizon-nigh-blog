[Quip adds spreadsheets](https://quip.com/blog/spreadsheets)  

I’ve been using Quip for a while and I can’t say enough [good things](http://blog.horizon-nigh.org/2014/06/01/david-sparks-on-iwork-collaboration-in-the-icloud.html) about them. They are one of my all-time favourite apps on iOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Up to this point, they’ve focused on collaborative word processing, and their iOS app isn’t just a little better than Google Docs–it’s a million times better. They have a web app, too.

Now that they have spreadsheets, there is absolutely no reason for me to ever go back to Google Docs. Thank goodness.
