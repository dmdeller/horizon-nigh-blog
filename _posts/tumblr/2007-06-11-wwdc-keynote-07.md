You can read this pretty much anywhere else, but oh well.

1. New Finder for Leopard - finally. Although at first glance, it looks a bit too much like iTunes for my taste. No real way to know how good it is till I see more of it.
2. New Dock - looks shiny. Shiny is almost (well, usually) always good.
3. Time Machine - yeah, we already knew about it, but I was looking for a way to do backups anyway, so I’m happy
4. Safari for Windows - probably to facilitate the development of…
5. iPhone apps - which will run with the iPhone’s version of Safari, via JavaScript/XML/(HTML?) 
All in all, not too exciting, but not too much of a letdown - like Macworld 07 was, ugh. Mainly because I don’t really care about the iPhone. It’s nice, I guess; I just don’t have much interest in phones/PDAs/tiny computers/whatever.
