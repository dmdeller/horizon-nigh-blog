[GitHub for Mac 1.1](https://github.com/blog/988-github-for-mac-1-1)  

Great update that adds per-line committing. This should be a lot simpler for many people to understand than the stage, and covers almost as many use cases. I think Iâ€™ll try switching from GitX to this full-time for a while, and see if it works for me as a replacement.

I [really](http://blog.horizon-nigh.org/2011/06/22/github-for-mac-launched.html) [admire](http://blog.horizon-nigh.org/2011/06/29/designing-github-for-mac.html) the way they are rethinking the version control workflow and trying to make it easier and better.
