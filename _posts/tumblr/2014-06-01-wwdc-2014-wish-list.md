iOS 8:

- Conference calling for FaceTime Audio (more than two people)
- Separate DND schedule for weekend (vs. weekdays)
- Offline Apple Maps
- Which apps are using the most battery power?
- Inter-app communication (almost any solution would be better than the current state of affairs)
- Let me see more than 9 icons at a time in a folder (on iPad)
- Fix lock screen passcode entry. If I tap the digits too quickly, it misses some. Regression since iOS 7.0
- [UISafariViewController](https://twitter.com/BigZaphod/status/457218268822900736)
- [UMA/GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicensed_Mobile_Access), i.e., Wi-Fi calling (on supporting carriers, e.g. T-Mobile)
- Let me set [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) as my default search in Safari
- Get rid of Newsstand
- Do something about push notification spam
- Do something about the game IAP plague
- And finally: finish what was left [unfinished](/2013/06/15/thoughts-on-wwdc-2013.html).

OS X:

- Just don’t totally ruin it, please. OS X has got a good thing going here. Be _careful_ with those low-contrast pastels and that unreadable text…

Apple TV:

- Anything. Anything at all. (Besides more unwanted icons cluttering up my home screen.)
- Crash less?
