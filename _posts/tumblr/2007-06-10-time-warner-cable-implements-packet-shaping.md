[Time Warner Cable Implements Packet Shaping](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/10/0645232&from=rss)  

That is, any service they don’t like will be purposely degraded.

I wonder if they will [degrade encrypted traffic](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1859/125/) too, since they can’t see what’s inside? Or maybe the scary-sounding language at the end of the [press release](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,18468495) means they’ll simply terminate your account if you have a suspiciously high amount of encrypted traffic - either way, sucks to be you if you have a [legitimate need](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Private_Network) for it.

Sad. I’ve used EarthLink Cable through Time Warner for a long time, and I’ve been very satisfied with their service thus far.
