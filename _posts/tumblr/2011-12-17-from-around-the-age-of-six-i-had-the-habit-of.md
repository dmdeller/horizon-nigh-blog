title: From around the age of six, I had the habit of sketching from life. I became
  an artist, and from fifty on began producing works that won some reputation, but
  nothing I did before the age of seventy was worthy of attention. At seventy-three,
  I began to grasp the structures of birds and beasts, insects and fish, and of the
  way plants grow. If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by
  the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential
  nature. At one hundred, I may well have a positively divine understanding of them,
  while at one hundred and thirty, forty, or more I will have reached the stage where
  every dot and every stroke I paint will be alive. May Heaven, that grants long life,
  give me the chance to prove that this is no lie.
