[iGoogle's themes are really nice](http://www.google.com/ig)  

I only just tried out the ‘themes’ feature of Google’s personalised homepage, now called iGoogle. They’re really nicely done. Apparently they change based on the time of day, too!

I don’t really care about the functionality of the page, but it’s nice to look at. I’m making it my new start page.
