[Apple Modifying iPhone 5 For T-Mobile Bands, Existing Devices Won't Have AWS Support](http://www.tmonews.com/2013/03/apple-modifying-iphone-5-for-t-mobile-bands-existing-devices-wont-have-aws-support/)  

I got my ‘existing device’ 3 months ago for use with T-Mobile. I got screwed.

**Edit:** I went and talked to the people at the Apple Store, and explained my discontent. They were friendly and helpful and I would recommend that anyone else in my position do the same. I’ll leave it at that.
