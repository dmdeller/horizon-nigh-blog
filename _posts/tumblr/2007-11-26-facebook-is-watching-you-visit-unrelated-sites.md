[Facebook is watching you visit unrelated sites, and reporting it to your friends](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jktmzai0_n_sMBgH_jfy6QXNS_6gD8T299HG0)  

Incredible.

> The box alerts users that information is about to be shared with Facebook unless they click on “No Thanks.” It disappears after about 20 seconds, **after which consent is assumed.**

(Emphasis mine.)

> The idea is that if users see a friend buy or do something, they’d take that action as an endorsement for a movie, a band or a soft drink.

Feeling exploited yet?

> Users are able to decline sharing on a site-by-site basis, but can’t withdraw from the program entirely.
