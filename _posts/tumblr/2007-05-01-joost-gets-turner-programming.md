[Joost gets Turner programming](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070501-joost-signs-on-cnn-other-programming-in-advance-of-official-launch.html)  

Still very little worth watching on the entire service, IMHO. There were a few music videos I liked; that was about it. Maybe I’ll try Robot Chicken. ATHF isn’t my thing. Maybe I’m just not the target audience.

The Daily Show would be awesome, but it seems like Comedy Central is being too cautious for that.

Oh well. I still have invites, if anyone wants.
