[Justin Williams on why iCloud Documents isn't that great either](http://carpeaqua.com/2013/03/28/why-elements-for-icloud-doesn-t-exist/)  

Reminds me of a fun story:

I was helping my sister set up her first iPhone, giving her advice on which things she should try. When we tried to turn on Notes for iCloud in Settings, it refused, with an error message stating that you must activate an iCloud Mail account before you can use Notes with iCloud. (She hadn’t done so because she wanted to keep using Gmail.)

Conclusion: Notes still uses IMAP for ‘iCloud’ syncing. It doesn’t use any of the three iCloud methods (key-value, documents, Core Data) that are available to third-party developers.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>

Justin’s customers probably wonder why he doesn’t just do with his notes app what the official Notes app does.

1. What a bizarre error message this must seem to someone not technical enough to guess the reason behind it! I helped her set up an @icloud.com email address that she would never use, and logged into the the iCloud _web site_ (!) on a computer **(!!!)** so that it would automatically forward to Gmail, just in case someone ever did try to use it to send her email.
