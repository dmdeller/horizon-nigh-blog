[Radiohead - In Rainbows](http://www.inrainbows.com/)  

In case you somehow haven’t heard by now, Radiohead’s new album will be released this morning (UK time - it’s already the 10th there). For now it’s download-only, 160kbps MP3s (no DRM), and you can pay any price you wish for it, including £0.00. No strings attached. For real.

I really liked Hail To The Thief (does that mean I’m not a real fan? Unsure on this. Oh well) and I’ve heard a live performance of Videotape and so I’m really looking forward to this.

A special edition vinyl + double CD package will follow in December for £40, with a traditional mass-market CD sometime next year.
