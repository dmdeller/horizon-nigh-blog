[St. Vincent's Mixtape Delivery Service](https://itunes.apple.com/us/curator/st.-vincents-mixtape-delivery/id1002618148)  

This is a show on Beats 1 that aired from 10–11 PM EDT tonight. I tuned in out of mild curiosity, but ended up listening for the entire hour. I don’t think an attempt by me to describe it would do justice, but it was really great. I’m not even really into music _by_ St. Vincent, but I definitely want to hear this show again. (I’m not sure if there’s a way you’ll be able to hear a replay of what I heard?) It was also neat to see others on Twitter reacting to the same thing I was listening to, at the same time. I think I’m starting to understand the idea behind Beats 1.
