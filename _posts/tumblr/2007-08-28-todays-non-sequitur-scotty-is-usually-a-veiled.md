Today’s [Non Sequitur](http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur/2007/08/28/). ‘Scotty’ is usually a veiled reference to Scott Kurtz, author of webcomic [PvP](http://www.pvponline.com/). At least, it was [last time](http://www.websnark.com/archives/2004/12/wiley_blinks.html).

Let’s see how we can interpret this. Uh, Kurtz’s comics will never appeal to mainstream because he uses too much internet/gamer-related culture? Except it would be kind of silly for Wiley to single out Kurtz for this, if indeed that’s what he’s doing, because PvP is known in the land of webcomics more than anything else for being generic sitcom humour. It would make a lot more sense for Wiley to use this strip against, say, [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com). But then, Penny Arcade wouldn’t care; they might even fire back scathingly at Wiley. The most Kurtz is likely to do is get all uppity and offended in a blog post.

Or maybe I’m imagining all this and 'Scotty’ was just a random name chosen.
