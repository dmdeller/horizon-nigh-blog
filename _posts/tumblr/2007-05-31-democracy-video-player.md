[Democracy video player](http://www.getdemocracy.com/)  

This is kind of neat. Downloads video podcasts, even has built-in BitTorrent if necessary. Plays any type of video. Has a directory of feeds. Does video a heck of a lot better than iTunes. You can even download stuff from YouTube, and save a YouTube search as an automatically-updating feed.
