[Wii to Get Pay-To-Play Game Content](http://nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=15391)  

Oh no.

> The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Pay & Play service will allow users to spend Wii Points to purchase content or services for Wii games, extending the capability and longevity of those games.

I hope this doesn’t mean what I think it does: you’ll have to start paying extra for stuff you would have otherwise gotten included in the initial purchase price. Sony and Microsoft have been doing this, and it’s evil.
