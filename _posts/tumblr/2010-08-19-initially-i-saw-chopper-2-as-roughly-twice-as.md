title: Initially, I saw Chopper 2 as roughly twice as complicated as Chopper 1, so
  thought it would take twice as long. But this was a mistake. I’d neglected to think
  about all the complexities introduced by the relationships between all of the new
  features. An analogy would be a number of people shaking hands. Two people means
  one handshake, but double it to four people and you get six handshakes. Much of
  the coding complexity is in the handshakes.
