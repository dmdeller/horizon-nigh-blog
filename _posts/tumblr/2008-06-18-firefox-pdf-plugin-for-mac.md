[Firefox PDF Plugin for Mac](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7518)  

Displays PDFs within the browser window using Mac OS Xâ€™s very fast built-in PDF engine.

(For fun, compare to all the extensions that Windows users install to _avoid_ displaying PDFs, due to the terrible and slow Adobe plugin.)
