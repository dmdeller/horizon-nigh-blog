[Apple Software Update for Windows offering to 'update' Safari that was never installed to begin with](http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/03/21/apple-software-update/)  

> Apple has made it incredibly easy — the default, even — for users to install ride along software that they didn’t ask for, and maybe didn’t want. This is wrong, and borders on malware distribution practices.

This is sure to hurt Apple’s reputation among people who know enough to see what’s going on, but also result in Safari conversions from people who only just barely know how to use their computers. Will the benefit to Apple outweigh the harm? I’m sure they have made internal predictions, but it was clearly a business decision at the expense of ethics.
