While I usually try not to link rumours too much, this was too good to pass up:

> _Gizmodo_ has heard that PowerPC support may indeed be living on … contrary to running consensus that OS 10.6 “Snow Leopard” would only support Intel chips. [[MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2008/06/07/powerpc-support-in-mac-os-x-10-6-after-all/)]

_Running consensus?_ So the rumour mill decides what Apple will and will not do, now? Or does the giant echo chamber that is the ‘blogosphere’ think that reality is a democracy? Hilarious.
