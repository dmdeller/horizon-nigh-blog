[OpenOffice.org Mac OS X Aqua Developer Preview](http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/download/aqua.html)  

This is a very early public alpha version of OOoâ€™s official effort to port their program to the Mac, without the need for ugly Unixy X11.

For the time being, of course, most Mac users will still want to stick with [NeoOffice](http://www.neooffice.org) (the developers of which seem to be [taking this in stride](http://trinity.neooffice.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=122), despite having been inexplicably excommunicated from the official OOo efforts).
