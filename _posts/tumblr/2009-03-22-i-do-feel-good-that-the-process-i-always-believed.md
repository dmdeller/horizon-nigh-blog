title: I do feel good that the process I always believed in and really defended –
  about feeling the story instinctively as you go through it, and not being tied to,
  “Oh, we know exactly how it’s going to end up” – that that was true. We were able
  to get there and could say, “We’ve been making this mosaic, and now we just need
  to put the final touches on it and we’ll have a complete picture.” There’s loose
  threads and things that don’t quite work, but I think that’s in the nature of almost
  any show. By and large, I think we did a pretty good job of it.
