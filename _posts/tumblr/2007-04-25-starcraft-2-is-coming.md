[StarCraft 2 is Coming](http://www.evilavatar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=29004&)  

Exciting, even for a casual player such as myself.

Probably won’t run well on my computer, though. :( That’s why I prefer the idea of console gaming.

**Update** : I guess this was a bit [premature](http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/04/27/blizzard-to-announce-new-title-at-worldwide-invitational). Oh well, someday.
