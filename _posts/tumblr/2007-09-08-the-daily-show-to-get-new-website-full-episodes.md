[The Daily Show to get new website, full episodes online](http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/technology/tech-mtvnetworks.html?ex=1346817600&en=302931c753190e43&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss)  

Well! It would be hard for them to do worse than the current website, which is an unnavigable mess of half-broken Flash.

> [The new site] will archive the entire video history of the show including headlines, interviews and the “Back in Black” feature.

I would really like to know if that ‘including’ means _'including, but not limited to’_ or _'we didn’t actually mean it when we said “entire video history” a few words ago’._ However:

> The portal also will present the previous evening’s episode in its entirety an hour or two after its broadcast.

I will settle for that. Not having the episodes chopped up and randomly rearranged with various parts missing is enough to make me happy. I don’t even mind if there are interstitial ads.
