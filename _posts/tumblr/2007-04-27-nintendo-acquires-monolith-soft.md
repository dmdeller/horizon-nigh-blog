[Nintendo acquires Monolith Soft](http://www.evilavatar.com/forums/showthread.php?t=29098&)  

Whoah. Monolith is made up of ex-Square employees. (There seem to be very few Square employees from the good old days still left at Square.)

Yeah, so I didnâ€™t really love Xenosaga, but I still think they Monolith has potential. Or maybe I just want to believe.&nbsp;
