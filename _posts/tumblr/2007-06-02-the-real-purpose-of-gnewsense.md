[The real purpose of gNewSense](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/11/06/gnewsense)  

gNewSense is a derivative of Ubuntu Linux, which seeks to leave out absolutely everything that’s not [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). Now, Ubuntu already aims to use Free Software when possible, but when it comes down to it they’ll still offer a proprietary solution if it’s the only one available.

When gNewSense was announced, I joined much of the Linux crowd in shaking my head asking ‘why?’ - it may be nice philosophically, but it results in a lot of difficulties (read: things that don’t work), and hence is very much less useful, pragmatically speaking.

And lo, here is the answer to my question, which I only just stumbled upon:

> [gNewSense is] like a reference implementation for Free Software. Standards often (alas, not often enough) ship with a reference implementation which focuses on correctness at the expense of everything else (including performance, scalability, and backward compatibility). You’re not actually supposed to use reference implementations in the real world; you’re supposed to test against them. gNewSense is the reference implementation of software freedom …

If you use Linux, knowing that your hardware works with it _now_ is good; knowing that your hardware will _always_ work with Linux is better. Again, this is from my purely pragmatic approach to software, as I try not to get caught up in the silly holy wars that abound.

It looks like gNewSense is going to be spun back into [yet another 'flavour’](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-April/000276.html) (third paragraph) of Ubuntu, and supported by the latter community.
