[Dropbox adds support for synchronised databases](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/43/the-datastore-api-a-new-way-to-store-and-sync-app-data)  

First thought: iCloud is over. Dropbox is now a complete iCloud replacement for developers, and with a much better chance of it actually, y'know, working. The only apps using iCloud will be Appleâ€™s own apps.

Second thought: If Apple had succeeded in buying Dropbox, this is what iCloud could have been. Alas.
