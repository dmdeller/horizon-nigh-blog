[What exactly is '3G', anyway?](http://blog.ksplice.com/2010/08/3g-and-me/)  

Turns out it’s ‘whatever your cell phone company wants you to buy right now’ (paraphrasing).

> If the carrier sold you “384 kbps Internet access anywhere in the coverage area, outdoors,” that would be something you could hold them accountable for. The carrier might even have to put a brake on signing up new customers until it could build new towers or license more spectrum for everybody to share, if it made that guarantee.
