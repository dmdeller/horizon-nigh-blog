[Mac OS X Hints: 10.5: Use Automator to create 'sticky' folder views](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20071103210253772)  

Recently I decided to switch to [‘Spatial Finder’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_file_manager), i.e., each folder opens in a new window and remembers its position, i.e., what the Finder was like before OS X. (You can toggle this behaviour with the 'pill’ control on the right side of any Finder window.)

So far I’m happy to be back, except for the [problem](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/12#divided) in Leopard in which it won’t remember the View setting (as Icons/as List) for each folder. This change was intentionally made by Apple because they liked it this way for Browser (non-Spatial) mode, and didn’t seem to notice that it broke a very important part of Spatial mode.

Which brings me to my point, the [linked article](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20071103210253772): it makes this somewhat simpler by giving you a menu item you can use to force Finder to remember the View. The instructions look complicated, but they’re not too bad.

What gets me most about this is: I have another machine that runs Ubuntu Linux. Its equivalent of Finder is called Nautilus. When I set Nautilus to Spatial mode, it does everything perfectly. More perfectly than the software by Apple, the people who _invented_ Spatial mode… and then broke it.
