[Bare Bones Software's Travails with iCloud Sync](http://rms2.tumblr.com/post/46505165521/the-gathering-storm-our-travails-with-icloud-sync)  

I’ve been reading many complaints about iCloud for some time now, but this tidbit in particular was news to me:

> And we find it noteworthy that, to the best of our knowledge, none of Apple’s currently shipping products on Mac OS X use iCloud to sync Core Data.

This is the one sole thing that every developer needs to know about iCloud right now. If only this had been common knowledge from the start. When we can see Apple themselves using it, then _maybe_ it works… but certainly not before.
