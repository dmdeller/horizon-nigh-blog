[Apple or Nintendo?](http://www.macuser.com/games/oh_apple_will_play_your_game_y.php)  

Apple’s Greg Joswiak:

> The PSP and DS represent the old school of gaming: big bulky devices with an old-fashioned distribution model.

The second part of this is simply false. Sony has been selling PSP games as downloads through their [PlayStation Store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Store) for months now. Nintendo will soon be doing the same with [DSi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSiWare).

> Because again the computer power and the 3D graphic power here [iPod Touch] is significantly greater than what you have here [picks up Nintendo DS]. So this allows people to do significantly higher quality games.

Weasel words. Maybe it ‘allows’ for that, but it isn’t happening. Video game consoles have been around a while now, and the companies who have perched on their high horses and proclaimed their technical superiority as the #1 selling point are the ones who have lost.

It’s all about the software, stupid. I always have my iPod touch with me, and yet if I want to play a game when I go somewhere, I have to take my DS or PSP with me. Why is that? Maybe they’ll figure it out. Maybe not.

OTOH, Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aimé:

> Whether you chose to play on your DS or listen to music on your iPod, we’re already in the same competitive space for time.

Despite being the clear market leader in the games space, they’re not becoming complacent.
