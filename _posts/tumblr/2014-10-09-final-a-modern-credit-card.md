[Final, a modern credit card](https://getfinal.com/)  

Looks nice. I’m not so concerned about the one-time-use card number feature, although I can see how it would be useful. More important to me is that it’s made by people who seem to care about design and UI, which is more than you can say about most banks. If they can pull it off, I’ll very likely switch.

Reminds me a little of [Simple](https://www.simple.com), which I’ve been hesitant to try so far because it feels difficult to trust a random startup (which isn’t actually a bank) with one’s life savings. A credit card, though, seems like much less of a risk.

In common with Simple, however, I hate the name.
