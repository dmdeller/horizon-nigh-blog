[New York Times discovers the identity of Fake Steve Jobs](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/technology/06steve.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin)  

Fake Steve, in character, is [not happy](http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/08/damn-i-am-so-busted-yo.html) about this; although, his alter-ego, [Dan Lyons](http://floatingpoint.wordpress.com/) of Forbes, doesn’t seem to mind all that much.

> Recently someone claiming to be Mr. Jobs’s daughter, Lisa, wrote to tell him, “You don’t sound at all like my father, but your blog is hilarious.”

That was pretty much my take on it, too.&nbsp;

Like most things associated with Real Steve, what he really thinks about it is a mystery. I can only imagine he’s probably not happy about the rather negative portrayal of himself, but obviously he can’t say or do anything negative after it’s become such a cultural phenomenon, because it would be bad P.R.

> As for Mr. Jobs himself — the real one — he did not seem all that interested when told the identity of his online doppelganger. He said in an instant message conversation that he had no interest in reading [Fake Steve Jobs’s upcoming in-character] novel.

I think the NY Times author just wanted to brag about being on an instant-messaging basis with Real Steve.
