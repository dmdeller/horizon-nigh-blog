[David Pogue: Tech Tips for the Basic Computer User](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/tech-tips-for-the-basic-computer-user/)  

Unlike most such lists of ‘tips’, this is a surprisingly good article.

> If you can’t find some obvious command, like Delete in a photo program, try clicking using the right-side mouse button. (On the Mac, you can Control-click instead.)

This is actually why Apple refused to ship a two-button mouse for so many years: hiding functions in contextual menus is poor design because it is not discoverable by users. Shipping computers with a one-button mouse forced developers to make applications that work with only one button (even though the computer and OS fully supported as many buttons as you want).
