[Thanks for clearing that up](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/why-the-vita-tv-and-other-microconsoles-are-destined-to-fail/)  

Article headline:

> Why the Vita TV and other “microconsoles” are destined to fail

First sentence of final paragraph in said article:

> This isn’t to say the Vita TV (or other microconsoles based on low-cost portable technology) will be a total bomb.

Okay.
