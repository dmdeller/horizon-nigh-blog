[Ubuntu 7.04 SiS mouse bug fixed](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/108221)  

I figured itâ€™s only fair to note that they fixed [the problem](http://blog.horizon-nigh.org/post/1136450) I complained about earlier. I finally upgraded from 6.10 to 7.04, and it works fine now.
