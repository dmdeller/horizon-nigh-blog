[Ubuntu bug #108350: PS/2 mouse does not work](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/108350)  

I really like Ubuntu, and I won’t hesitate to use it on any non-Mac (and maybe even older Macs) that I’ll ever own. But with every release they do, I start to doubt more and more that I’ll ever be able to recommend it to my non-programmer friends and family…
