title: 'The last session of WWDC ‘09 yesterday was about publishing on the App Store.
  The content of sessions is under NDA, so I can’t tell you what it was about. So
  I’ll tell you what wasn’t in it: the audience Q&A session that succeeded nearly
  every other WWDC session and usually provided invaluable access to Apple employees
  and useful additional knowledge to attendees. The session itself blew through its
  lightweight examples quickly, ending 45 minutes early. The majority of the audience
  was clearly there for the Q&A. As people lined up at the microphones around the
  room, the presenter abruptly showed a simple slide with only “WWDC” in plain lettering,
  thanked us for coming, and bolted off the stage. The Apple engineers, usually staying
  around the stage for one-on-one questions, were gone. The lights came up instantly,
  and it was the only session that didn’t end in music. The audience was stunned.'
