[While iPhone price is halved, AT&T raises price of starting monthly service by $10](http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=25791)  

This is exactly the opposite of what would get me to buy an iPhone. Sigh. I don’t mind paying for the device, but I simply don’t use $70 worth of cell phone service per month.

Moreover, this brings the total minimum price of the mandatory two-year contract up by $240, which is more than the amount of the iPhone price decrease ($200).

This is on top of the fact that AT&T has ended their revenue sharing agreement with Apple - they now get to keep it 100% of the monhtly service price to themselves.
