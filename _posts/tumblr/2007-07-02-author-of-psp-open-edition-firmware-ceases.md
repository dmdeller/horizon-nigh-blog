[Author of PSP Open Edition firmware ceases development](http://www.psp-vault.com/Article1030.psp)  

That’s no good. I hope someone picks up where he left off, or else I might be stuck at 3.40 OE-A. I think it might be possible to go back to an official Sony firmware, but I’m not going to do that and lose the ability to run non-Sony software.

If newer games start requiring 3.51+, then I’m in trouble (and so are lots of other people)… especially if Wipeout Pulse does so (which is likely). I knew the risks when I first installed OE, but it still sucks.
