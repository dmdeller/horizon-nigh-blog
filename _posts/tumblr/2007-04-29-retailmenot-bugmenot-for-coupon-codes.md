[RetailMeNot: BugMeNot for coupon codes](http://www.retailmenot.com/)  

I went to BugMeNot recently and noticed this. Could be handy, especially with its bookmarklet that works the same way as BugMeNotâ€™s (e.g., drag to your bookmarks toolbar, browse to somestore.com, click it, and it brings up any codes for somestore.com).

Fair amount of noise, though, just like BugMeNot.
