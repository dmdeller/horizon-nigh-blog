[YouTube: A New Way To Embed YouTube Videos](http://apiblog.youtube.com/2010/07/new-way-to-embed-youtube-videos.html)  

This post is from last year, but I’ve started seeing HTML5 YouTube embeds in the wild recently, and I was curious about it. So I went to a random YouTube video and looked for the embed link, and it gave me the ‘new way’ embed code by default.

So either they’ve switched this on for good, or they’re in the process of doing so. You can never really tell with Google and their silent, slow roll-outs.

But I can confirm it works nicely with the Flash plugin uninstalled (as I’ve had it since Apple stopped shipping it with new Macs), even if you’re not in the ['HTML5 trial’](http://www.youtube.com/html5). The sad part is, though, I still don’t get the HTML5 fallback when browsing the YouTube web site itself - only if I join the HTML5 trial, which, for me, has only ever worked sporadically and randomly turns itself off.
