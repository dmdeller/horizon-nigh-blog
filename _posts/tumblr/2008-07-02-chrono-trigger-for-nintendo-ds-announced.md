[Chrono Trigger for Nintendo DS announced](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=16261)  

It’s basically just a port with accomodations for the DS’s screens, but I certainly wouldn’t mind an excuse to play this game again. Hopefully they’ll keep the extras from the PSX port.

And hopefully they’ll get going on THE NEXT ONE in the series. I refuse to believe it’s not going to happen…
