[Pidgin 2.0.0 finally released](http://pidgin.im/)  

Gaim 2.0 was originally announced in October 2005, and the original ETA was the end of that month. Due to legal complications over the name, of all things, it’s been delayed a year and a half. Now it’s finally here, with a new name, a new website and a new look (oi, if you thought the Adium duck was ugly…)

Back when I used Windows, it was the only IM program I could tolerate after the increasing malware-ness of the official clients. If you can live without voice and video ([Skype](http://www.skype.com) is the only decent way to do that anyway), I recommend it to all Windows users as a cleaner, less annoying way to IM. Whatever IM service you use, Pidgin supports it. Former Gaim users should of course upgrade. Mac users will want to stick with [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com), natch.
