[Marco Arment's Kindle Fire review](http://www.marco.org/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-review)  

I find this ‘list of thoughts’ format much easier to read than the narrative style of most product reviews. It covers a wide array of relevant points, while avoiding the tendency to ramble.

> [UI problems happen] a lot when waking the Fire from sleep, when it has no connection for a few seconds before the Wi-Fi reconnects.

Reminds me of [this interesting article about 'rapid DHCP’](http://cafbit.com/entry/rapid_dhcp_or_how_do) that Apple uses.
