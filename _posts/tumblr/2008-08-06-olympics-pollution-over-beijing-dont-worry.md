[Olympics: Pollution over Beijing? Don't worry, it's only mist, say officials](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/06/olympics2008.china)  

> Official readings collated by Beijingâ€™s municipal environmental protection bureau yesterday gave an air pollution index (API) of 91 for Beijing as a whole, and 87 at the Olympic stadium. The World Health Organisation regards an API of more than 50 as high, and a reading of 100 or more is considered unsafe.
