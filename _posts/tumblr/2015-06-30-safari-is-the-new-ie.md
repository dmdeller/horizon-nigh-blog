[Safari is the new IE](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/)  

I don’t think it’s quite as bad as the headline makes it sound, but I do seem to be seeing an increasing number of sites that simply tell me they don’t work in Safari. The most frequently frustrating example of which is [Bootstrap’s customise tool](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/).

**Edit:** As long as iOS is so popular (and doesn’t allow changing the default browser), users probably don’t have much to worry about. That doesn’t mean web developers have to be happy about it, though.
