[Debian 5.0 released](http://debian.org/News/2009/20090214)  

Interesting that they’re shipping KDE 3.5.10. After the [disaster](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Software&articleId=9126619&taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=5) that KDE 4 has been, and considering that most other distros have moved to KDE 4 anyway, Debian [could be](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/14/1952222&from=rss) your best bet if you want to use a stable and full-featured version of KDE. Since it’s Debian, it will be supported for a while.

Obligatory: I use GNOME, but, whatever floats your boat.
