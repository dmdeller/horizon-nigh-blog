The repair window is blocking the updater window. But the repair window isn’t responding to clicks. I can’t focus it and it doesn’t appear in Exposé. It isn’t even raised when I click the Updater icon in the Dock.

I’ve tried this several times, always with the same result. I end up deleting Adobe Reader in frustration.

Until I need it back again because Marketing sends me AI files. (Yes, I know Preview can open them; no, it doesn’t do a passable job.)

The icing on the cake is that it’s not possible to download the latest version of Adobe Reader from their web site. It’s not posted anywhere. You have to get an installer that’s several versions old, and then use their updater to get the latest (which contains ‘important security updates’). I guess it’s too much work for them to update the download link when they make a new build?

Ancillary Point 1: No, I do not wish to have an Adobe plugin ruining Safari’s perfectly capable built-in PDF rendering. No sane person who understands what this means would ever choose this. Good thing it’s selected by default and surrounded by lots of scary 'repair’ language. Which leads me to…

Ancillary Point 2: If I never installed the plugin in the first place, how can you 'repair’ it? If it’s an optional component, why does it 'require’ repair? Does anyone at Adobe read what they are typing?
