title: Git has taken over where Linux left off separating the geeks into know-nothings
  and know-it-alls. I didn’t really expect anyone to use it because it’s so hard to
  use, but that turns out to be its big appeal. No technology can ever be too arcane
  or complicated for the black t-shirt crowd.
