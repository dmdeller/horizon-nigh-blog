[Rentzsch on git subtree](http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/22061209807)  

I’ve long since switched from submodules to [git subtree](https://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree) for all of my projects, but I’ve never really articulated why: just a general sense from having used submodules that they’re unnecessarily painful to use.

The best thing about git subtree is that, for many use cases, the other developers working with me _never even need to know it exists_.

One thing I discovered from Rentzsch’s post is that there’s an [even better fork](https://github.com/helmo/git-subtree) of git subtree that improves some of the command-line messiness. I had actually been considering writing some of those changes myself (you know, ‘when I get around to it’). Now it looks like I don’t have to; awesome. I haven’t tried the fork yet, but it sounds like it’s exactly what I need.
