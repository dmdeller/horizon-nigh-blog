[Yet another release of Lego Star Wars](http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/05/24/lego-star-wars-to-come-back-with-all-six-movies-in-one-game)  

This one combines both previous games (covering all 6 movies) with some extras, and will be for the systems that havenâ€™t yet had any version: 360, PS3, Wii. And a new DS version, since the original was apparently [full of bugs](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/lego-star-wars-2/why-i-hate-lego-sw2-for-the-ds-201171.php).

Lightsabre battles with the Wiimote sounds fun, if they do it well.
