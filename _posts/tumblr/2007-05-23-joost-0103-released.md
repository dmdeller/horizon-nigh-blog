[Joost 0.10.3 released](http://joost.com/blog/2007/05/joost-10.3-released.html)  

The ‘Now for Friends’ tagline for this release apparently refers the the ability to send people links directly to shows or channels (yay, I guess?) - here’s a link to [Adult Swim](http://joost.com/099000b), for example.

Very little else has changed, but it still deletes all of my preferences (i.e., the channels I picked for my lineup) when I upgrade to the new version, as it has with every new version.

There’s also now even trashier content than before ('Sports Illustrated Swimsuit on Demand’? WTF?) that is causing my hope for the service to wane.
