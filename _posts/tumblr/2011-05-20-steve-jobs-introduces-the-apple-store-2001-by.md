Steve Jobs Introduces the Apple Store (2001) (by [vintagemacmuseum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLTNfIaL5YI))

_Every single one_ of them is connected to the internet!

And the red ‘hotline’ phone like in the Oval Office - great. Too bad they don’t still have that.

The Apple Store didn’t make its way to Rochester, NY until many years later, so the wooden-tables Apple Store is the only one I remember. I did buy a few things there back when you still had to walk to a cash register at the back of the store. I still think I prefer that - never did get used to having to flag someone down and awkwardly wait while their iPod Touch (previously, a Windows CE device) completes the transaction.
