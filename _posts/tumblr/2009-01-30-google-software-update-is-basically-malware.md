[Google Software Update is basically malware](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/01/google-software-update-refuses-to-be-uninstalled.ars)  

It tags along with other software without your knowledge.<sup>1</sup> It installs itself without your consent. It fights your attempts to get rid of it.

I’ve alluded to this before. I still don’t understand how Google thinks this is okay.

It looks like my [earlier assessment](/2009/01/05/picasa-for-mac.html) that this had been unbundled from Picasa was incorrect. The only difference is that it is now even more sneaky.

1. Burying something in a EULA absolutely does not count as informing the user. It didn’t get other malware vendors off the hook and it doesn’t get Google off the hook either.
