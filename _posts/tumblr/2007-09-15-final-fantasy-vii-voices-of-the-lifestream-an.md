[Final Fantasy VII: Voices of the Lifestream, An OverClocked ReMix Album](http://ff7.ocremix.org/)  

A very interesting listen, if you liked the original soundtrack. (Just skip the first song.) A lot more varied styles (although somewhat less cohesive) than [Chrono Symphonic](http://chrono.ocremix.org/), which I also recommend.
