At the risk of showboating a bit, I ended my 8+ year customer relationship with Virgin Mobile the other day. I can’t think of any other company that I’ve continually paid a recurring service fee to for that long. I’ve never used anyone else for cell phone service. I’ve never had a cell phone contract, and with any luck, I never will.

I signed up during my freshman year in college<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, with their cheapest phone, a [Kyocera K7 Rave](https://horizon-nigh.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-media/kyocera-k7-rave.jpg). I remember it because of the cool name. It glowed blue, and was generally a piece of junk, but to me it was an amazing novelty. The number pad fell off after three years or so (remember when it was normal to keep a cell phone for that long?).

Until last week, I was still grandfathered into the $0.18/minute plan that hasn’t been offered for quite a long time.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> All I had to do was add at least $20 every 3 months to keep my line active, and considering how little I talk on the phone (and the fact that I make most calls from my cheap VoIP line when I’m home), I almost never paid more than the minimum, which meant I paid about $7/month for cell phone service. I used to love telling people that and seeing their reactions.

I’ve had no real complaints about the voice service. I was rarely anywhere that I can remember not having a signal. Not many missed calls after the first year or two.

But things have changed. The world has changed. I wanted an iPhone since it first came out, but I couldn’t stand the idea of a contract, even if broke-college-student-me could have afforded one. So I got an iPod Touch as soon as I could. I loved it.

Then I decided I wanted to make iPhone apps. So I did, and I got a job making them. And it began to get more and more ridiculous that I, an iPhone developer, didn’t have an iPhone. I was still stuck with a beat-up old flip-phone that could only make phone calls, an iPod Touch, an iPad, and a Virgin Mobile MiFi that was so buggy and temperamental that it couldn’t even power itself on properly half the time.

I was certainly paying attention when Virgin Mobile announced they would carry the iPhone. But I soon found out that they would be locking the SIM slot, with a policy of not unlocking it under any circumstances. That doesn’t sit well with me. If they felt like subsidising the phone gives them the right to tell me what I can or can’t do with it, fine. But if I pay full price–which is what they’re charging–that should mean I own the phone, not them; I should be able to do what I want with it, including switch to another carrier if I want. And the fact that I stayed with them for so long should show that it doesn’t take much to keep me happy. But the idea of not being _allowed_ to do something with my own property is what drives me crazy. It’s too bad.

I ported my number away late last week. Not a peep from them. I called just to make sure I was not going to be charged any more. I was told in an indifferent tone that my account had been automatically cancelled. No follow up. No asking why I left. No thanks for my years of being a good customer and paying on time. I don’t know what I expected; they didn’t owe me anything, any more than I owed them anything.

Oh well. I guess not everyone is as sentimental about these things as I am.

1. Yes, robot stalkers from the future, this means you now know what year I went to college. I trust you will use this information unsympathetically to screw me out of a job opportunity or something.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)

2. Last I checked, they still have a similar $0.25/minute plan, but you really have to look hard to find it on their web site. At this point though, AT&T has a better deal with GoPhone for $0.10/minute, if anyone still cares about getting a phone just for phone calls.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:2)
