[Can Apple read your iMessages?](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/06/can-apple-read-your-imessages.html)  

Remember, ‘won’t’ is different than 'can’t’.

The difference is that 'won’t’ is equivalent to 'can be forced to do it in secret by our government’.

I still think Apple is trying to do the right thing here and that it is a net positive for the majority of users who have no knowledge or expectation of encryption. Maybe it can stop some eavesdropping, maybe not–it’s better than not even trying. But that doesn’t mean that you should trust it with your secrets. Trust nothing that you can’t verify yourself.
