[The Smashing Pumpkins' new album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_%28The_Smashing_Pumpkins_album%29)  

I just heard about this. Also, the [first single](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4l2gWD08eU) is circulating. It’s… good, I think!

This is technically only half of the Smashing Pumpkins (no D'arcy, no Iha). Oh well, take what you can get. I wonder if this will last.
