Whew! I’ve done it: I hacked up a comments add-on to Tumblr (which powers this site). Later, I may cobble it together in the form of an open-source package, or at least explain how I did it (it’s fairly hackish, involving JavaScript). For now, though, why not leave a comment to this post, just because you can? :)
