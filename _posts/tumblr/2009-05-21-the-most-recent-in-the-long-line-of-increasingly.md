[The most recent in the long line of increasingly ridiculous App Store rejections](http://www.blog.montgomerie.net/whither-eucalyptus)  

How many times is this going to happen before Apple fixes their completely broken review process?

**Edit:** &nbsp;[it’s now approved](http://www.blog.montgomerie.net/hither-eucalyptus), which almost certainly wouldn’t have happened had this story not travelled all across the internet. This same story [keeps happening](http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/106345745/apple-rejected-an-iphone-app-that-remotely) over and over again. I wonder, for each of these bad rejections we do hear about, how many of them [don’t we hear about](http://twitter.com/stevenf/status/1731056524) because the author’s blog isn’t so popular? And what recourse do they have then?
