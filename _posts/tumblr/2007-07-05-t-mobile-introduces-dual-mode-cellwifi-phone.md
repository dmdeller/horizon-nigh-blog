[T-Mobile introduces dual-mode cell/WiFi phone; unlimited calls when on WiFi](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/05/technology/circuits/05pogue.html?ex=1341288000&en=39e3cc8226651f90&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss)  

Very interesting use of technology and pricing. I tried to summarise it here, but I ended up trying to fit in so many caveats that I scrapped it all. Still, I think this shows promise. (via [DF](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/july#wed-04-tmobile))
