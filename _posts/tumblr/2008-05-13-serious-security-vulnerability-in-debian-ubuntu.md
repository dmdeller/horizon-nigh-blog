[Serious security vulnerability in Debian, Ubuntu SSH package](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/13/1533212)  

Yikes. Now’s a good time to run Update Manager. Your key will change, which means you’ll get a scary warning when you next try to login remotely.

Edit: Ubuntu’s package manager will automatically regenerate your machine’s bad SSH key. Debian’s will not. (Just verified myself on both OS’s.) Debian will post instructions [here](http://www.debian.org/security/key-rollover/) once they get around to writing them.
