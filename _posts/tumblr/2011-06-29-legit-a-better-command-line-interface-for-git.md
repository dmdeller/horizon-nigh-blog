[Legit - a better command line interface for Git](http://kennethreitz.com/legit-the-sexy-git-cli.html)  

Inspired by GitHub for Mac, this new project aims to provide the same more intuitive interface ideas, except on the command line instead of a GUI. Looks promising.

Nitpick: I can’t stand it when technology is described as ‘sexy’. It’s an absurd non-sequitur that makes me question the writer’s motivations. More pragmatically, it provides no useful information as to why I should be interested in it. Even a mundane adjective like 'better’ says more, in that it’s not actively anti-communicative.
