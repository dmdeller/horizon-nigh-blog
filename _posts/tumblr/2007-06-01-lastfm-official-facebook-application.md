[Last.fm - official Facebook application](http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/31/lastfm-on-facebook)  

It sucks compared to the [unofficial one](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2371452733) that was out first.

> … it’s currently very difficult to put “real-time” information on profile pages without requiring a click. (This is why we have to put your recently-played tracks in a tab for now, sigh.) We know this is less than ideal, and hopefully this situation will improve soon.

It sounds like they’re just going to wait for it to fix itself. Meanwhile, the unoffical app, while not perfect, copes admirably. (Some blame for this must rest with Facebook - displaying an up-to-date RSS feed isn’t exactly brain surgery these days.)

Not to mention that the thing is a huge ugly advertisement for last.fm that sticks out like a sore thumb.

The current official [Twitter app](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2231777543) is much the same, both in being obnoxiously gaudy and failing to update reliably.
